    Bean: Do you mind?
    Mean: What’s with all the interruptions!?
    Lean: What now!?
    Archie: Hello gentleman…what’s going on out here?
    Mean: Poker! What does it look like? 
    Lean: You want in?
    Archie: No, thank you, I’m rather busy at the moment… 
    Bean: Probably for the best, we can’t even get through one game without something busting through that window.
    Archie: What do you mean?
    Lean: He’s talking about the gun. We were just minding our business, playing our game, when it came flying through that window. Just a little while ago.
    Bean: Something threw it.
    Mean: Something? Probably a human there, bud. 
    Lean: And how do you know? None of us saw what it was.
    Mean: Because of the opposable thumbs, you idiot. Who else could have *thrown* it but a human?
    Lean: Well I don’t know! There’s some really big rats around, ok?!
    Bean: You think a rat lugged a gun through the bathroom window?
    Lean: Well remember that really huge rat at last week’s poker session? She came in through the bathroom window.
    Mean: Ain’t that a Beatles song?
    Bean: They don’t exist yet, stupid.
    Mean: Oops, forget I said that.
    Archie: Fellas, fellas, could we get back to the matter at hand?
    Bean: What?
    Archie: That someone disposed of a gun here!
    Bean: Such good timing too, because I was out of chips. It gave me something else to bet with.
    Archie: I don’t think you gentleman understand the severity of the situation here. Someone inside was shot with a gun.
    Mean: Yeah, that was loud, huh?
    Lean: What are the odds that happened and then a gun showed up here, huh? Weird.
    Archie: I’m going to have to ask you to hand over that firearm, fellas. That could be vital evidence.
    Bean: No way! I’m betting with that.
    Lean: Don’t go ruining our game!
    Archie: I need that gun.
    Mean: Then go get us something else to bet with!
    Bean: Yeah, we can’t play without betting material.
    Archie: Ok, ok… I’ll be back with something else…

        Archie: I’ve got a bone to pick with you fellas.
        Bean: Did he just say bone!?
        Lean: He couldn’t have, we lost our bone.
        Mean: Well he’s back now, must have something important to say, otherwise he’s dead meat.
        Archie: Don’t get your hair in a mess, I’ve brought my own bargaining chip. This bone is a whole lot better to bet with than a gun. What do you say?
        Bean: It’s a deal!
        Mean: Here you go!
