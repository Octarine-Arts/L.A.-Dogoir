Archie: If you were here, you must have seen something?
Rattus: You sure ask a lotta questions. Maybe Rattus saw somethin’, maybe he didn’t. What’s in it for him if he tells you what he saw? Tell ya what, I’m awfully hungry. Find Rattus some food and then maybe he’ll talk.
Archie: Some food?
Rattus: Yeah, yeah… some cheese would be nice. Run along now, little pet.

Archie: I got you some cheese like you asked.
Rattus: Give it ‘ere!
Archie: Not so fast. Tell me what you know, and then I’ll give you the cheese.
Rattus: Hmph. Fine. Rattus saw two of them humans, saying somethin’ about a safe.
Archie: A safe? What exactly did they say?
Rattus: They was talkin’ about the code on account of one of them forgettin’. 
Archie: And? Did they say what the code was?
Rattus: Yeah, it was BDFA.
Archie: Thanks for your help, Rattus, here’s the cheese.
Rattus: ‘Bout time. Give it ‘ere!
