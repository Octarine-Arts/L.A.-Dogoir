    Loretta: I’m much too upset about current events to talk, Detective. This is just too much for my nerves!
    Detective: I understand that it must be difficult, ma’am, but I really must insist you answer a few questions. I have to find out everything I can if we’re to catch the murderer.
    Loretta: Very well. I’m an actress you know, I can master my emotions under any circumstances. Even ones as trying as these.

Detective: You don’t often see women in establishments like this, do you come here often?
Loretta: I’m a performer, I sing here most weeks. It’s something to fill my time while I wait for Hollywood to come knocking. Which shouldn’t be too much longer, mind you.

Loretta: Not particularly well… he was a regular here, that much I knew. He would watch me perform, he seemed to have an appreciation for my music. Most people do, of course.

Detective: Dale Butterbur says you were the closest to the victim when he returned from restoring the lights. Impressive journey to make in the dark from the bathroom.
Loretta: What on earth are you insinuating, Detective? You think that I killed a man in cold blood? Just when my career is about to take off? What on earth would I do such a thing for! The very idea!
Detective: Just doing my job, Miss.

Detective: You told me you were in the bathroom when the murder occured, but you failed to mention the blood on the floor in there? I can’t imagine you missed it.
Loretta: Oh, that. Uh, yes, well I did see it. Of course I did. I was just so flustered about the murder when you asked. It must have…slipped my mind.
Detective: Miss Dubois…
Loretta: Yes, yes, alright. That blood…is mine. That thug “Two Sleeves” or whatever ridiculous thing he calls himself… He came in while I was in there. He said something about money Jack owed, said that I should pay up since Jack couldn’t. 
Loretta: I mean, what nonsense! I don’t owe anything. So I told him that very thing. Well, being the brute he is he hit me. But I’m fine, Detective, don’t worry about me. Unlike poor Jack I lived to tell the tale.

Detective: What did you think of King Kong when you saw it last night?
Loretta: Oh, I loved it! It was a little silly but I just adore Fay Wray. She is très magnifique! 
Loretta: Wait...
Loretta: ...How do you know I was…
Detective: Did Jack take you to the movies often, Miss Dubois?
Loretta: I, uh…I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Detective: Miss Dubois…there’s no point acting dumb with me now. I know the two of you went to the movies last night. He had two tickets in his pocket and his wife didn’t go with him.
Loretta: It was rather rude of you to trick me into admitting it like that, Detective. I suppose you think you’re awfully clever.
Detective: Just a little. But perhaps it’s time to come clean about your relationship with Jack Harlow.
Loretta: Very well, Detective. Jack and I were…friendly with one another. But is that such a crime?
Detective: Mr. Harlow had a wife, so it just might be a crime, depending on how friendly you were.
Loretta: Alright, alright. Yes, Jack and I were seeing each other. But obviously this proves my innocence. I wouldn’t kill the man I love, would I?
Detective: So you loved him?
Loretta: Yes. I did. Jack could be severe. But he was straight-forward and honest. And he was certainly better than a lot of the men out there. Especially the ones in show business. 
Loretta: So yes, Detective, I was seeing him. But I didn’t want him dead. Perhaps instead of scrounging around in my personal affairs, you go and find out who really killed him.
